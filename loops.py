######## while loops

count = 0 # count is 0
while (count < 9): # check if count is lower than 9
   print 'The count is:', count  # print count
   count = count + 1  # add 1 in count
  # Repeat
print "Good bye!" # print gooy bye! after finishing the while loop

# the upper while loop will print the count from 0 to 8

########The Infinite Loop

var = 1
while var == 1 :  # This constructs an infinite loop, because var will always be 1 :)
   num = raw_input("Enter a number  :")  # show the input popup when it runs
   print "You entered: ", num # print the number when user enter number in input and hit enter

print "Good bye!" # print gooy bye! after finishing the while loop


########  Using else Statement with Loops
count = 0
while count < 5:
   print count, " is  less than 5"
   count = count + 1
else:
   print count, " is not less than 5"
# Don't be a dumb you know it, try to understand yourself.
